      "q1": {
        "question": "What is the difference between Umrah and Hajj?",
        "answer": "Umrah is a voluntary pilgrimage that can be performed at any time of the year, while Hajj is an obligatory pilgrimage that must be performed during specific days in the Islamic month of Dhul Hijjah. Umrah involves fewer rituals and can be completed in a few hours, while Hajj takes several days and involves more complex rituals."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Do I need a visa to travel to Saudi Arabia?",
        "answer": "Yes, you need a valid Umrah or Hajj visa to enter Saudi Arabia. We handle the visa application process for all our customers, including document preparation, submission, and tracking. The visa is typically valid for 30 days and allows multiple entries."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What documents do I need for Umrah?",
        "answer": "You need a valid passport (minimum 6 months validity), passport-sized photos, vaccination certificates, and proof of accommodation. We provide a complete checklist and assist with document preparation to ensure a smooth application process."
      },

      }
    },
    "booking": {
      "q1": {
        "question": "How far in advance should I book my Umrah package?",
        "answer": "We recommend booking at least 2-3 months in advance to secure the best prices and availability. During peak seasons (Ramadan, Hajj period), we suggest booking 4-6 months ahead as packages sell out quickly."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Can I modify or cancel my booking?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can modify your booking up to 30 days before departure. Cancellation policies vary by package type and timing. We offer flexible options and will work with you to find the best solution for any changes needed."

        "question": "Do you offer group discounts?",
        "answer": "Yes, we offer special group rates for families and groups of 10 or more people. Group bookings also include additional benefits like dedicated group coordinators and customized itineraries. Contact us for a personalized quote."

        "question": "Where will I stay during my Umrah?",

      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Are there any hidden fees?",
        "answer": "No, we believe in transparent pricing. All costs are clearly listed in your package details. The only additional costs might be personal expenses, shopping, or optional services you choose to add."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Do you offer refunds?",
        "answer": "Refund policies depend on the timing of cancellation and package type. We offer partial refunds for cancellations made well in advance. Full details of our refund policy are provided at the time of booking."
